In June I attended ICAF 2017, organised by the International Committee on
Aeronautical Fatigue and Structural Integrity, in Nagoya, Japan. For more on
ICAF and my active participation since 1995, please see my earlier post for ICAF
2015.

While there, to my surprise (and honour), ICAF’s General Secretary, Prof. Anders
Blom, invited me to present the Plantema Memorial Lecture (the ‘keynote’) at the
next ICAF Symposium, which will be held in June 2019 in Krakow, Poland.
