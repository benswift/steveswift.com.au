Dr David Hoeppner passed away on Friday, 18 February 2022, aged 86. Aircraft structural integrity lost a pioneer. I lost a mentor and friend.

I first met Dr Hoeppner in 1987 when I attended the course he delivered for the FAA at the University of Utah. It started a professional and personal friendship that lasted 35 years. I will fondly remember Dr Hoeppner as:

* A ***leader***, genuinely, as evidenced by many followers
* A ***mentor***, who imparted guiding principles for my career
* ***Ethical***, he knew ‘you can’t have structural integrity without human integrity’, as he quoted Willis Hawkins 
* A ***family man***, who valued work but kept it in perspective 
* An ***encourager***, who brought out the best in people
* ***Caring***, especially when he hosted me at short notice after my accommodation plans fell through
* ***Empathetic***, especially when he understood my disappointment and frustration after the FAA rejected my advice on Aero Commanders
* ***A story teller*** who brought lessons to life
* ***Courageous***, especially on matters of principle and justice 
* ***Diligent***, seizing every opportunity (‘carpe diem’ was his motto)
* ***Humble***, rare for an international expert
* ***Personal***, interested in you as a person and not just as an engineer
* ***Influencer*** (his holistic concepts are increasingly promoted and practiced)
* ***Humorous*** (he told a good joke and could laugh at himself)
* ***Generous*** with his knowledge, time and money.

We shared a love for the Lord. I will miss him until we meet again.
