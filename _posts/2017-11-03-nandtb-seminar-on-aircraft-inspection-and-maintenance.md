title: "NANDTB Seminar on Aircraft Inspection and Maintenance"
---

NDT and maintenance experts from around Australia met for two days of
presentations, discussions and exhibitions on the theme of 'Higher Standards,
Better Compliance'. Mr Jeff Boyd, Chairman of the CASA Board, gave the Keynote
Address.

I gave two presentations. The first was my own, on the '[Fundamentals of
Aircraft Fatigue](http://steveswift.com.au/papers/)'. The second was a Textron
presentation on 'Cessna SIDs'.

You can find a PDF of my presentation in the list under
