title: "Aviation Law Conference 2017"

I attended this conference to help me keep in touch with the aviation lawyers
who retain me as an expert witness. Although I always leave the legal issues to
the lawyers, as I should, because it is important I don’t interfere in matters
outside my expertise, I feel it is also important to understand my main audience
for when I write my expert reports and give evidence in court.

Please see my earlier post on the ‘Aviation Law Conference 2016’.
