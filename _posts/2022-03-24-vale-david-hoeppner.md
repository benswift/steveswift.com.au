Dr David Hoeppner passed away on Friday, 18 February 2022, aged 86. Aircraft structural integrity lost a pioneer. I lost a mentor and friend.

I first met Dr Hoeppner in 1987 when he taught me the FAA's short course on 'Aircraft Fatigue' at the University of Utah. It started a professional and personal friendship that lasted 35 years. I will fondly remember Dr Hoeppner as:

* **Leader**, genuinely, as evidenced by his many followers
* **Mentor**, who imparted guiding principles for my career
* **Ethical**, he knew ‘you can’t get structural integrity without human integrity’, a quote he loved from Lockheed's Willis Hawkins 
* **Family man**, who valued work but kept it in perspective 
* **Encourager**, who brought out the best in people
* **Caring**, especially when he hosted me at short notice after my accommodation plans fell through
* **Empathetic**, like when he understood my disappointment and frustration after regulatory politics caused an authority to reject me 
* **Story teller** who brought lessons from history to life
* **Courageous**, especially on matters of principle and justice 
* **Diligent**, seizing every opportunity (‘carpe diem’ was his motto)
* **Humble**, rare for an international expert
* **Personal**, interested in you as a person and not just as an engineer
* **Influencer**, his holistic concepts (HOLSIP) are increasingly promoted and practiced internationally
* **Humorous**, he told a good joke and could also laugh at himself
* **Generous** with his knowledge, time and money.

We shared a love for the Lord. I will miss Dr Hoeppner until we meet again.
