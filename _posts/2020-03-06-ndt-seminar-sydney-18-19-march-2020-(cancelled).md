title: "NDT Seminar, Sydney, 18-19 March 2020 (Cancelled)"
---

**Update: On 12 March 2020, the NANDTB cancelled the Seminar because of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.**

Nondestructive testing (NDT) is often the last line of defence against
structural failure. If the NDT misses a fatigue crack, there are usually no
second chances after a wing breaks.Â Yes, NDT is vital to aviation safety. I
therefore recommend to you this next seminar organised by Australia's National
Aerospace NDT Board (NANDTB).

I am on the NANDTB and will speak on: 'A Life Saving Conversation --- When the
design engineer calls ...'. Others will speak from CASA, airlines, NDT vendors and
Defence. There will be vendor displays.

and to register (great value at only $150). I hope to see you there!
