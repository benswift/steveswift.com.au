## Specialised knowledge

The airworthiness of the airframe:

The 'airframe' is the aircraft's skeleton. It's 'airworthiness' is about
ensuring it is always strong enough and stiff enough for the aircraft to do
everything it was designed to do, without breaking, or even bending in any
unsafe way.

(Lawyers will note my heading's consistency with section 79 of the _Evidence Act
1995 (Cth)_, relevant to expert witnesses.)
